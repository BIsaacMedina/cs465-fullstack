# cs465-fullstack

In completing the full stack web application project, we employed a variety of frontend development techniques, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and single-page application (SPA) frameworks. Express HTML provided a straightforward method for serving static pages and embedding server-side logic, while JavaScript enhanced interactivity and responsiveness. The SPA approach allowed for dynamic content updates without page reloads, resulting in a smoother user experience. This mix of technologies ensured a flexible and efficient frontend. On the backend, we utilized a NoSQL MongoDB database due to its scalability, flexibility in handling unstructured data, and ease of integration with JavaScript-based applications, making it ideal for dynamic web applications.

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) played a crucial role in bridging the frontend and backend. Unlike JavaScript, which is a programming language, JSON is a lightweight data interchange format. It is easy to read and write for humans and easy for machines to parse and generate. JSON facilitated seamless data exchange between the frontend and backend, enabling efficient communication and data manipulation. Throughout the development process, we frequently refactored code to enhance functionality and efficiency. For example, by modularizing code into reusable UI components, we improved maintainability and consistency across the application. These reusable components reduced redundancy and allowed for easier updates and scalability.

API testing was critical for ensuring the reliability and security of our application. We conducted various types of API testing, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, to verify the correctness of request and retrieval methods. The inclusion of security layers, such as secure login authentication for the admin panel, added complexity to the testing process. Understanding methods, endpoints, and security measures was essential to ensure that our application could handle requests securely and protect sensitive data.

This course has been instrumental in helping me achieve my professional goals. It has provided me with hands-on experience in full stack development, from designing and implementing frontends and backends to ensuring data security and efficient communication. I have learned to work with modern web technologies, developed my skills in creating robust and scalable applications, and gained a deeper understanding of the importance of testing and security in web development. These skills have made me a more marketable candidate in the field of computer science, preparing me for advanced roles in software development and engineering.
